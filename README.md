# Weather Forecast Application

### An Application that showing weather state of next 5 days.

## Available commands:

Install with `yarn install`

Start developing with `yarn start`

run spect-tests with `yarn test`

## Technical:

Using expressjs to build proxy server
Using Hooks to build mini-redux
Using Parcel for simplifier task running
Using Jest and Enzyme for testing

## Note

Because of CORS, a proxy server must be built, therefore I'm using ExpressJs to build one for Application development.
